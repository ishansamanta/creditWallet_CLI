This is A CLI based simple credit card manager based on Beginner to intermediate OOP fundamentals (Python). This code is written in python and is under rigorous development and new features will be updated regularly.
# CONCEPTS INCLUDED : instructors (__init__()) method. Defining various functions. Calling the functions at the end using a Command Line User interface where user will enter their choices.
# Mechanism :The code mainly runs on infinite loop where the condition is always true until the user explicitly wants the function to be shut down by typing "-1", guided in the code.

A simple self made project which is under development and will continuously be updated.
Thank you
